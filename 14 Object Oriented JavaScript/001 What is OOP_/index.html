    <h1>What is Object Oriented Programming?</h1>
    <p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data and methods to
        manipulate that data.</p>
    <h2>Key Concepts of OOP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, or
            class.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another
            class.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Ability to present the same interface for different underlying data types.
        </li>
    </ul>
