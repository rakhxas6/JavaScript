    <h1>What is Constructors?</h1>
    <p>Constructors are special methods in object-oriented programming that are called when an instance (object) of a
        class is created.</p>
    <p>They are used to initialize the object's properties and allocate resources.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, constructors are defined using the `constructor` method within a class.</p>
