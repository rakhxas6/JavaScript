    <h1>What is Class Inheritance?</h1>
    <p>Class inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class (called a subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called a superclass).</p>
    <p>This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subclass:</strong> The class that inherits from another class.</li>
        <li><strong>Superclass:</strong> The class from which properties and methods are inherited.</li>
        <li><strong>Overriding:</strong> Providing a new implementation for a method in the subclass that already exists in the superclass.</li>
    </ul>
