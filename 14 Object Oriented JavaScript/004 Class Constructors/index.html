    <h1>What is Class Constructors?</h1>
    <p>Class constructors are special methods for creating and initializing objects created within a class. They are called
        when an instance of the class is created.</p>
    <h2>Key Concepts of Class Constructors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Class constructors allow for the initialization of object properties at the time of creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Logic:</strong> Constructors can include custom logic to set up an object, such as validation or default values.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Constructors:</strong> JavaScript does not support method overloading, but you can achieve similar behavior using default parameters or conditionals within a single constructor.</li>
    </ul>
