    <h1>Class Methods & Method Chaining</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, classes are a blueprint for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to manage and organize code.</p>
    <h2>Class Methods</h2>
    <p>Class methods are functions that are defined inside a class and can be called on instances of that class. They can access and modify the instance's properties.</p>
    <h2>Method Chaining</h2>
    <p>Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. This is possible when methods return the object itself.</p>
